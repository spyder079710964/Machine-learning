# Machine-learning
In this project we have carried out an exploratory data analysis (EDA)on a given database.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing and visualizing data to gain insights and understanding of the underlying patterns, relationships, and trends in the data. EDA is a critical step in the data analysis process and is often done before formal modeling or hypothesis testing.
We start by importing a number of libraries
We then load the data into the programme, clean the data which involves checking for missing or erroneous data, handling outliers, and removing any duplicates and carry out a relationship analysis.
Using the same data set we have also carried out a Univariate analysis which involves analyzing each variable individually to understand its distribution, range, central tendency, and variability.
We have also carried out a Bivariate analysis which involves analyzing the relationship between two variables to understand the strength and direction of the relationship. This can be done through scatter plots, correlation matrices, and heat maps.
